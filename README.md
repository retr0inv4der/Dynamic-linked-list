# Dynamic-Hashmap

A lean, dynamic hash-map implementation in C++ (100% native) for high-performance, low-level use.  
Designed to handle growth, collisions, and dynamic resizing with minimal overhead.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Generic key/value mapping using templates.  
- Automatic resizing when load factor crosses threshold.  
- Handles collisions via chaining (linked lists) or open addressing (depending on build).  
- Straightforward API: insert, remove, find, clear, iterate.  
- Minimal dependencies â€” just standard C++ library.  
- Optimised for systems programming, kernel-adjacent work, or high-throughput infrastructure.  

## ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s in the repo?

- `HashMap/` folder: core hash-map template implementation.  
- `LinkedList/` folder: auxiliary linked-list class used for chaining.  
- Pre-compiled binary/shared objects (`.so`) for quick testing.  
- Support files and examples (if any) to demonstrate usage.  

## ðŸ§  Why use this?

If youâ€™ve outgrown `std::unordered_map` or need finer control over memory allocation, performance characteristics, and resizing strategy â€” this implementation gives you the tools to build a custom, high-performance associative container tailored to your needs.  
Also ideal for educational purposes: understanding how hash maps work under the hood.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/retr0inv4der/Dynamic-hashmap.git
   cd Dynamic-hashmap
   ```
## Build (example using g++):

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -I./HashMap -I./LinkedList example_main.cpp -o example_app
```
# In your code:

```cpp
#include "HashMap/HashMap.hpp"

HashMap<int, std::string> map;
map.insert(42, "meaning");
if (auto* val = map.find(42)) {
    std::cout << *val << "\n";
}
map.remove(42);
```
